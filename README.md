# FVis
This Python module is intended as an aid for the participants of AST3310 at the University of Oslo.

It provides an easy way of dealing with a less educational, but rather time consuming aspect of writing a fluid simulation; 
the saving and visualisation of calculated data.

#### Here is what the module can do for you:
* Run your simulation for a given amount of time and save the resulting data to binary files.
* Read data previously saved by the module.
* Show a 1D or 2D animation of a quantity that can be derived from the stored data.
* Save the animation as an mp4 file.
* Plot the time evolution of the average value of a quantity (useful for checking if something is conserved).

All these actions are performed with a few simple function calls in your main program.

#### Installation
Just download [FVis.py](FVis.py) (in the linked page, click 'Raw' and then right-click => Save as..) to your working directory and you are good to go.

#### Usage
Check out the [User guide](User guide/FVis_user_guide.pdf) for instructions on how to use the module.
